Image Cropper Property Editor for Umbraco V7
============================================

The Image Cropper property editor allows backoffice users to position pre-defined image crops on media items.
Using the ImageProcessor the images are manipulated on-the-fly.

Installation
============

1. Install ImageProcessor and ImageProcessor.Web using Nuget (http://jimbobsquarepants.github.io/ImageProcessor/)
2. Drop the folders from this repository into the corresponding folders of an Umbraco V7.0.1 instance.
3. Create a new data type of type "Image Cropper" in the "Developer" section in the Umbraco backoffice.
4. Add the predefined crops settings
5. Assign the data type to an image mediatype in the "Settings" section of the Umbraco backoffice.

Disclaimers
===========

This is just something I've build to see if I could do it. There will probably be errors.
